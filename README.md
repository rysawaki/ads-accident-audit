# ads-accident-audit

A domain-agnostic post-incident audit framework
for determining responsibility when complex automated systems fail.


Applied to:

Automated Driving Systems (ADS/ADAS)

Large Language Models (LLMs)

Critical Infrastructure Control Systems (e.g., power grids)


This repository provides a neutral audit framework.
It does not assert fault or assign liability.

This audit framework is derived from the broader SIA (Self-Imprint Attribution) research.
